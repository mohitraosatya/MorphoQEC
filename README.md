# AdaptiveMorphoCode

AdaptiveMorphoCode is a proof-of-concept project that demonstrates a novel, reinforcement learning–driven approach to quantum error correction (QEC). By dynamically selecting the optimal QEC circuit from a set of candidate code architectures based on real-time noise estimation, this framework aims to reduce logical error rates and improve fault tolerance in quantum systems.

## Overview

Traditional quantum error correction schemes typically use a fixed QEC code. AdaptiveMorphoCode, inspired by biological self-organization and neural plasticity, dynamically “morphs” the QEC strategy over time. The project uses Qiskit and Qiskit Aer to simulate candidate QEC circuits under realistic noise models and integrates an RL agent to choose between candidates as the simulated hardware noise fluctuates.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Automatically switches between candidate circuits (e.g., one-qubit and three-qubit repetition code analogs) based on a time-varying noise model.
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration:** Uses a simple Q-learning agent to minimize logical error rates by making adaptive decisions.
- **Realistic Simulation:** Built with the latest version of Qiskit Aer and transpile techniques, ensuring a close approximation to what can be deployed on actual hardware.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Evaluates performance against fixed strategies (always using Candidate A or B) as well as a random selection baseline.

## Benefits for Google Quantum AI Research

- **Improved Resource Efficiency:** Adaptive selection of QEC codes can potentially lower logical error rates without requiring additional qubit overhead.
- **Enhanced Fault Tolerance:** Dynamic adaptation to time-varying noise levels may lead to more robust error correction, helping bridge the gap between physical qubit error rates and the ultra-low logical error rates needed for large-scale quantum computing.
- **Scalability and Innovation:** The approach is modular and scalable. It can be extended to more complex QEC layouts—such as full surface or color codes—and integrated into hardware pipelines.
- **Research Advancement:** This adaptive, machine-learning–based method provides a new pathway to optimize QEC that aligns with Google Quantum AI’s goal of using cutting-edge algorithms for hardware improvement and error mitigation.
